# CyberHygiene
This open source project will allow organizations to measure the Cyber Hygiene score of their employees to better measure and remediate individuals with higher risks, and package it into STIX or JSON and communicate it via TAXII or API.

The Cyber Hygiene for Kids Awareness Program will focus and provide educational tools to the Elementary Education system to improve kids cyber hygiene from an early age.
